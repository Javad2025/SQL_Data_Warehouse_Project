🏗️ Step 1: Create the Data Warehouse Database

First, we create the DataWarehouse database, which will store all the structured data for analytics and reporting.

CREATE DATABASE DataWarehouse;

Notes:
	•	Ensure you have the necessary permissions to create a database.
	•	If the database already exists, you may need to drop it first (use DROP DATABASE DataWarehouse; cautiously).
	•	This command should be executed in a PostgreSQL environment.

🏛️ Step 2: Create Schemas for Data Organization

To implement a layered architecture in our data warehouse, we organize the data into three different schemas:

CREATE SCHEMA bronze;
CREATE SCHEMA silver;
CREATE SCHEMA gold;

🔹 Schema Structure & Purpose

1️⃣ Bronze Schema 🟤
	•	Stores raw, unprocessed data directly from source systems (ERP & CRM).
	•	This layer is mainly used for data ingestion and is not optimized for querying.
	•	Data in this layer may contain duplicates, errors, and inconsistencies.

2️⃣ Silver Schema ⚪
	•	Contains cleaned and transformed data.
	•	Data integrity issues (such as missing values, duplicate records, and incorrect formats) are resolved here.
	•	Tables in this layer are designed for efficient analytical querying and business reporting.

3️⃣ Gold Schema 🟡
	•	Stores fully processed, aggregated, and business-ready data.
	•	Optimized for BI tools, dashboards, and decision-making analytics.
	•	Provides pre-aggregated and highly performant data models.

🚀 Next Steps

🔹 After setting up the schemas, the next step is loading and transforming data within each schema. Stay tuned for additional scripts covering:
	•	Data ingestion (loading CSV files into the bronze schema).
	•	ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes to move data from bronze ➡️ silver ➡️ gold.
	•	Creating indexes and optimizing queries for faster performance.
